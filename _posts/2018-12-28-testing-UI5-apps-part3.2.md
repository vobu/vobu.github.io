I've published the fourth part of my blog post series on "Testing UI5 apps" over at [blogs.sap.com](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/12/28/testing-ui5-apps-part-3.2-code-coverage-and-other-necessary-usefulities/).  
It essentially covers both headless- and multi-browser testing, along with some necessary-to-know Usefulitiesâ„¢ such as `QUnit.only` and `opaSkip`.  
The hands-on code part is (as usual) on github, for this article on branch [03_mock-cov-useful](https://github.com/vobu/openui5-sample-app-testing/tree/03_mock-cov-useful).
