Twice a year, the [DSAG AG UI experts group](https://www.dsag.de/arbeitsgremien/ag-ui-technologien/details) meets for technical discussions sourrounding the topic "UIs in SAP-verse". Today's meeting topic was a comparison of IDEs for [UI5](https://ui5.sap.com) development: [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and [SAP Web IDE](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/capabilities/product-info.SAP-Web-IDE.9e5c9d90-e8e0-4e82-aed2-09087a10c973.html).  

I sported WebStorm, the [accompanying "slides" are here](/materials/dsag_ui_exp_2018/).

**Spoiler alert**: there was no winner and no looser. In certain areas, one IDE is better than the other, with unique features in each. Expect productivity gains by: 
- using a combination of some of the IDEs for solving certain tasks
- integrate the primary IDE well into your development cycle (CI/CD, ticket system, VCS, docker, ...); using an IDE in a standalone fashion hinders efficient doing
