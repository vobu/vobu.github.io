So far, I've been publishing on both a [private blog](http://vobu-vobu.blogspot.com) and on the [SAP blogs](https://people.sap.com/#content:blogposts). This required double effort in the sense of writing once, then copying and adjusting for the second publishing space.

Moving to `gh-pages` will simplify this: it allows me to author content in `Markdown`, then publish it from the same source here and on the SAP blog.  

So here we go, let's sail. Salut.
